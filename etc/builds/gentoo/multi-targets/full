# This is the "full" multi target, which is used to generate a complete new
# "full" build.  Note the collect statemetn below. If our strategy/stage1 is
# "local", then this means that we generate our own stage1 tarball.
#
# However, if strategy/stage1 is "remote", that means that we use
# another build's stage1 tarball rather than generating our own.
