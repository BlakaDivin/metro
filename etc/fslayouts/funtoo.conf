# This file defines the mirror filesystem layout used by funtoo.org, and the
# default mirror filesystem layout for Metro. 
#
# In Metro lingo, a "mirror" is a location on disk that holds all the stuff
# that Metro needs as well as all the stuff it creates. So this means that this
# file defines the relative paths and filenames of everything that Metro will
# create, and relative paths and filenames of everything that Metro will
# require for its builds. The only thing that we *don't* define here is the
# actual location of our mirror, which is defined in the $[path/mirror]
# variable in /etc/metro/metro.conf. But this file defines how the mirror
# itself is organized.
