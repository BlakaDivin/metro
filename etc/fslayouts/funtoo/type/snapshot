# This is the path where we look for portage tree snapshots, which are tarballs
# that contain the contents of an entire portage tree. In Metro, portage tree
# snapshots may be either a simple tarball of file or a tarball of an active
# git repository. By default, each build has its own snapshot directory, as
# builds can use different portage trees.
