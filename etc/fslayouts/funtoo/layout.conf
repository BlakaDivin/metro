# This file defines the mirror filesystem layout used by funtoo.org, and the
# default mirror filesystem layout for Metro.
#
# In Metro lingo, a "mirror" is a location on disk that holds all the stuff
# that Metro needs as well as all the stuff it creates. So this means that this
# file defines the relative paths and filenames of everything (relative to
# path/mirror, defined in /etc/metro.conf) that Metro will create, and relative
# paths and filenames of everything that Metro will require for its builds.
