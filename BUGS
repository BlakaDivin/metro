Right now we merged in the support for STOREDIR, but it's very basic. storedir needs to be set to /var/tmp/catalyst.
This isn't exactly optimal. We need to make things sexy again and allow for the storedir's layout to be totally
configured. Might be good to actually have STOREDIR not be the mirror, dunno. So we can copy to the mirror only
if the build succeeds.

The parser allows multiple definitions of "foo" in a single file, which shouldn't be allowed. Instead, it should
be detected and an exception should be thrown.

The parser's conditional support means that order of evaluation matters. For example:

? subarch foo {
	bar: oni
}

subarch: foo

Will result in bar not being defined.
