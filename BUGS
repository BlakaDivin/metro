After removing the AUTOCLEAN code, it looks like catalyst doesn't autoclean at all. Example:
I masked coreutils-6.12 which was breaking a stage2 build (the /bin/touch in stage1 was broken.)
Then I deleted the old portage snapshot and restarted the ~x86 build. 5 minutes later I had
a new stage1! It should have taken at least 30 mins.

Right now we merged in the support for STOREDIR, but it's very basic. storedir needs to be set to /var/tmp/catalyst.
This isn't exactly optimal. We need to make things sexy again and allow for the storedir's layout to be totally
configured. Might be good to actually have STOREDIR not be the mirror, dunno. So we can copy to the mirror only
if the build succeeds.
