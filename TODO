allow multi-line references to be expanded into single-line references
with newlines/extra whitespace removed. This way we can have package
lists that look like this:

packages: [
	foo
	bar
	oni
]

A lot easier to maintain and read. Request from Caleb Cushing.

do lastdate with snapshots to avoid creating identical snapshot files
