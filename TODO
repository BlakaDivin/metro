ISO support

add kernel build support (genkernel or raw)

add a way to unmerge things you don't want, and maybe for Metro 1.4:

add a way to extend steps, so you can have a target-specific "Clean"
as well as a global clean. This should be part of the data model and
may use some kind of OOP or list concept?

allow multi-line references to be expanded into single-line references
with newlines/extra whitespace removed. This way we can have package
lists that look like this:

packages: [
	foo
	bar
	oni
]

A lot easier to maintain and read. Request from Caleb Cushing.

do lastdate with snapshots to avoid creating identical snapshot files
